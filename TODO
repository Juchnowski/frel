- Clean up code termination so that doesn't leave jobs hanging around
in the background on Ctl-C.

- Extend fragproxy code to allow simultaneous multi-level IP and TCP
attacks.

- Add application-level proxies to do level 7 obfuscation at the same
time. For instance, could do Rain Forest Puppy's tricks on Http
traffic before doing IP / TCP level fragmentation as well with the
fragproxy.
